# Drafting/Engineering Module Documentation

## Overview
The Drafting/Engineering Module provides comprehensive functionality for managing engineering drawings, documents, and workflows in the multi-platform app inspired by Concrete Vision. This module enables users to upload, view, modify, and collaborate on drawings and engineering documents, with support for revision control, markup annotations, and integration with external CAD systems.

## Core Features

### 1. Drawing & Document Management
- Upload, organize, and version control for engineering drawings (PDF, CAD, BIM, etc.)
- Secure sharing and access control
- Document categorization and tagging

### 2. Drawing Modification & Revision
- In-app markup and editing tools (annotations, redlines, comments)
- Issue and track drawing revisions
- Revision history and audit trails

### 3. Release & Distribution
- Release piece drawings for production, field, or client use
- Notify relevant stakeholders upon release or revision
- Approval workflows and sign-offs

### 4. Integration with External Tools
- Import/export from popular CAD/BIM/ERP systems (e.g., Tekla, Revit, AutoCAD)
- Synchronize piece-level data and drawing updates
- API connectors for third-party integrations

### 5. Linking & Contextualization
- Link drawings to specific projects, production elements, or tasks
- Contextual display within project management and scheduling modules
- Relationship mapping between drawings and other system entities

### 6. Collaboration & Workflow
- Assign review/approval tasks
- Manage communication and notifications related to drawing changes
- Role-based permissions and access control

## Module Structure

### Models
- `DrawingModel.js`: Represents a drawing document with metadata and version control
- `RevisionModel.js`: Tracks revisions made to drawings with approval workflows
- `MarkupModel.js`: Manages annotations and markups on drawings

### Services
- `DrawingService.js`: Core service for managing drawings and their lifecycle
- `DocumentService.js`: Service for managing engineering documents
- `CADIntegrationService.js`: Service for integrating with external CAD/BIM systems
- `WorkflowService.js`: Service for managing engineering workflows and approvals

### Components
- `DrawingViewer.jsx`: React component for viewing and interacting with drawings
- `DrawingList.jsx`: Component for displaying and managing a list of drawings
- `RevisionHistory.jsx`: Component for displaying and managing drawing revision history
- `DrawingDetails.jsx`: Component for displaying and editing drawing details

### API
- `routes.js`: RESTful API endpoints for the Drafting/Engineering Module

### Pages
- `DraftingEngineeringPage.jsx`: Main page component for the Drafting/Engineering Module

### Styles
- `drafting-engineering.css`: Stylesheet for the Drafting/Engineering Module components

## Integration Points
The Drafting/Engineering Module integrates with other modules in the system:
- **Project Management**: Links drawings to projects and tasks
- **Production Scheduling**: Provides engineering data for production planning
- **Field Module**: Shares drawings and markups with field personnel
- **Quality Control**: Associates drawings with quality control processes

## Usage
To use the Drafting/Engineering Module in your application:

1. Import the module:
```javascript
const { initializeDraftingEngineeringModule } = require('./modules/drafting_engineering');
```

2. Initialize with configuration and dependencies:
```javascript
const draftingEngineeringModule = initializeDraftingEngineeringModule({
  // Configuration options
}, {
  database: yourDatabaseInstance,
  // Other dependencies
});
```

3. Access services and components:
```javascript
const { drawingService } = draftingEngineeringModule.services;
const drawings = await drawingService.getDrawingsByProject('project123');
```

## API Endpoints
The module exposes RESTful API endpoints for integration:

- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/drawings`: Get all drawings for a project
- `GET /api/drawings/:id`: Get a specific drawing
- `POST /api/drawings`: Create a new drawing
- `PUT /api/drawings/:id`: Update a drawing
- `DELETE /api/drawings/:id`: Delete a drawing
- `GET /api/drawings/:drawingId/revisions`: Get all revisions for a drawing
- `POST /api/drawings/:drawingId/revisions`: Create a new revision
- `GET /api/drawings/:drawingId/markups`: Get all markups for a drawing
- `POST /api/drawings/:drawingId/markups`: Add a markup to a drawing
- `POST /api/cad/import`: Import from CAD file
- `POST /api/cad/export`: Export to CAD format
- `POST /api/cad/sync`: Synchronize with external CAD system
- `POST /api/cad/bom`: Extract bill of materials

## Future Enhancements
- 3D model viewing capabilities
- Mobile markup tools for field use
- Machine learning for drawing classification and data extraction
- Augmented reality visualization for field placement
