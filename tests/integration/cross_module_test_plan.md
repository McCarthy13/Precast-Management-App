# Cross-Module Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for validating cross-module integration in the Precast Concrete Management System.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify data flow and integration between all modules
2. Validate AI service functionality across modules
3. Ensure proper access control and permissions
4. Test mobile responsiveness of critical features
5. Validate deployment readiness

## Test Scenarios

### Project Lifecycle Integration

- **Project Creation to Production**: Verify data flows correctly from Project Management to Drafting/Engineering to Production Scheduling
- **Production to Shipping to Dispatch**: Validate the workflow from production completion through quality control, yard management, shipping, and dispatch
- **Document Management Integration**: Ensure documents are properly linked and accessible across relevant modules

### AI Service Integration

- **Production Scheduling AI**: Test optimization recommendations
- **Quality Control AI**: Validate defect detection capabilities
- **Yard Management AI**: Test yard layout optimization
- **Dispatch AI**: Verify route optimization functionality
- **Environmental/Sustainability AI**: Test impact analysis and recommendations

### Access Control and Permissions

- **Role-Based Access**: Verify different user roles have appropriate access to modules
- **Document Confidentiality**: Test that confidential documents are only visible to authorized users
- **Data Modification Rights**: Validate that users can only modify data they have permission to change

### Mobile Responsiveness

- **Field Services**: Test mobile interface for field operations
- **Quality Control**: Validate inspection interface on mobile devices
- **Yard Management**: Test piece scanning and location updates on mobile

### Deployment Validation

- **Clean Environment Test**: Verify application functions correctly in a fresh environment
- **Database Initialization**: Test database setup and initial data loading
- **User Account Setup**: Validate user creation and permission assignment

## Test Execution

1. Run automated integration tests
2. Perform manual validation of critical workflows
3. Test in clean environment before packaging
4. Document any issues found and their resolutions

## Success Criteria

- All automated tests pass
- Manual validation confirms proper cross-module integration
- Application deploys and functions correctly in clean environment
- All AI services provide expected functionality
- Mobile interfaces are responsive and functional
