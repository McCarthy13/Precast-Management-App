# QC Inspection Feature Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for the new Quality Control inspection feature and its integration with other modules in the Precast Concrete Management System.

## Test Environments
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)

## Test Categories

### 1. Functional Testing

#### Piece Arrangement
- [ ] Verify pieces can be dragged and reordered
- [ ] Verify arrangement is saved per user/session
- [ ] Verify arrangement persists between sessions
- [ ] Verify default order matches production schedule

#### Navigation
- [ ] Verify horizontal swipe navigates between pieces
- [ ] Verify vertical swipe navigates between pages of the same piece
- [ ] Verify navigation buttons work correctly
- [ ] Verify current piece/page indicators update correctly

#### Inspection Points
- [ ] Verify inspection points can be added by clicking on drawing
- [ ] Verify inspection points appear at correct coordinates
- [ ] Verify inspection points can be updated (status, notes)
- [ ] Verify inspection points persist between sessions

#### Inspection Completion
- [ ] Verify piece can be approved/rejected
- [ ] Verify piece status updates correctly after inspection
- [ ] Verify inspection history is recorded
- [ ] Verify notifications are sent to relevant users

### 2. Cross-Module Integration Testing

#### Quality Control → Yard Management
- [ ] Verify piece status updates in Yard Management after inspection
- [ ] Verify yard placement eligibility updates based on inspection status

#### Quality Control → Production
- [ ] Verify production schedule updates based on inspection results
- [ ] Verify pour eligibility updates based on pre-pour inspection

#### Quality Control → Shipping
- [ ] Verify shipping eligibility updates based on inspection status
- [ ] Verify piece cannot be shipped until post-pour inspection is approved

#### Quality Control → Document Management
- [ ] Verify inspection reports are properly stored in Document Management
- [ ] Verify drawing access permissions work correctly

### 3. AI Integration Testing

- [ ] Verify AI recommendations are generated for inspections
- [ ] Verify critical areas are highlighted correctly
- [ ] Verify similar issues from history are displayed
- [ ] Verify AI suggestions are relevant to the piece type

### 4. Performance Testing

- [ ] Verify page load times are acceptable (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Verify drawing rendering performance is smooth
- [ ] Verify drag-and-drop operations are responsive
- [ ] Verify system handles multiple concurrent inspections

### 5. Security Testing

- [ ] Verify only authorized users can access inspection features
- [ ] Verify role-based permissions work correctly
- [ ] Verify inspection data cannot be manipulated by unauthorized users
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are properly secured

### 6. Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify behavior with very large drawings
- [ ] Verify behavior with many pieces in a workspace/form
- [ ] Verify behavior with many inspection points
- [ ] Verify behavior with network interruptions
- [ ] Verify behavior when switching between inspection types

## Test Execution Plan

1. Unit Testing: Verify individual components work as expected
2. Integration Testing: Verify components work together correctly
3. System Testing: Verify the entire system works end-to-end
4. User Acceptance Testing: Verify the system meets user requirements

## Defect Management

All identified issues will be:
1. Documented with steps to reproduce
2. Prioritized based on severity
3. Fixed and retested
4. Verified in the integrated environment

## Success Criteria

The QC inspection feature will be considered ready for release when:
1. All critical and high-priority tests pass
2. Cross-module integration is verified
3. Performance meets acceptable thresholds
4. No security vulnerabilities are present
